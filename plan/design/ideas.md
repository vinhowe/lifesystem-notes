# ideas

## Points system that only works if you do recurring chores

## Requirement to justify not doing tasks or rescheduling things

## "study" sessions with information about studied and added Anki cards

This is an example of a really far-out idea that needs a clearer grounding.

## Study notes with support for searchable "question" syntax that allows me to go back and find out either what I was curious about or what I wasn't sure about (maybe "question" isn't a broad enough term for this)

I need to focus on finding a core product and building that. This is the kind of thing that I can build--paradoxically--only if I'm doing well enough without it.
