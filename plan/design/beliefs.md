# Beliefs

### _This needs to be combined with principles. Take all beliefs from the starter set and refactor them so they're in imperative mood instead of indicative mood ("I actively seek correction" becomes "actively seek correction")_

## Brief

I use these to maintain confidence in the face of uncertainty. My goal is to make the beliefs I agree with a part of my identity. Beliefs are not personal observations; they are model traits of an ideal character.

When I commit to follow a set of beliefs, I'm saying that I will do the best I can to act as if they are true even if I feel differently. Over time, as I act "in faith," I become the person I've modelled for myself.

I need a way to create and trial new beliefs (evaluating based on how valuable I feel they've been to me since I've created them, instead of how much I agree with them at any one point), and review my standing on existing beliefs.

This is about believing in a better version of myself, someone I can't see, but that I hope I can become. Beliefs are wings on a journey of identity.


How an evaluation might look:

```
belief evaluation
─────────────────
id  name                                level                   value                   notes

1   I actively seek correction.         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    < add >

2   I am careful about who              1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    < add >
    I take advice from.

3   I aim incredibly high, take         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10    < add >
    huge risks and learn from
    failure.

```

Notes can be added to any belief for any evaluation session by hitting enter (or clicking) on the "add" button under notes (This should really use the proposed document thing I've been thinking about):

```
belief evaluation > notes for "I actively seek correction."
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Here are my thoughts on this belief...

```

## How are these different than principles? Do we need both? How do they interact?


### Starter set:

#### I actively seek correction. (Because it's the best way to learn)

(I should tell people this right off the bat. That I actively seek correction and I would welcome it.)

Ray Dalio talks about ego blind spots and how there are parts of your personality that you can't see without talking to other people. He says he talks to "the smartest people I can find that disagree with me." I think if I  than to worry about looking good.could find really smart people who disagreed with me, and see why, I would be able to pick u than to worry about looking good.p on my faults, biases, and "ego blind spots" really quickly. This aligns perfectly with than to worry about looking good. the motivation behind my Insight symbol.
 than to worry about looking good.
Additionally, being corrected provides a v than to worry about looking good.aluable experience for both me and the person who's correcting me. I get closer to truth than to worry about looking good. and learn humility, and they get to teach someone what they know.

#### I am careful about taking advice.

This sits in apparent contradiction to "I actively seek correction." But this isn't the case; I try to learn as much as I can, especially about me and how I can improve, but I realize that much (if not most) of advice is either bad or irrelevant to me. I see myself as a kind of venture capitalist for advice; I try to get as much of it as possible in the hope that a small part of it will be really valuable.

But this isn't to say that I'm not appreciative. If I want people to correct me, it follows that I should make them feel comfortable by being gracious and open-minded, regardless of whether I accept the correction.

#### I aim incredibly high, take huge risks and learn from failure.
#### I have what some view to be an unreasonable amount of self-belief (though I validate my ideas by seeking correction).
#### I never do it alone if I can do it better with help.
#### It's more important to do the best thing than to worry about looking good.
#### I am insanely driven.
#### I am always playing the long game.
#### I am fiercely competitive, but I pick my battles carefully.
#### I am the first to talk (when meeting new people, when everyone's quiet, at an icebreaker, etc.).
#### I am energetic and fun to get to know.
#### I am a great listener.
#### I care deeply for the people in my life.
#### My beliefs are important to me.
#### I am a social optimist.
