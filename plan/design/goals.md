# Goals

## Measurement

### Example Study

Let's take an example goal of mine: Completing 9 chapters of my math book in 11 weeks. I have a rate that makes sense: 1 section per day.

```
chapter     sections+review     days

3           7                   7
4           6                   6    
5           7                   7
6           10                  10
7           5                       
8           9
9           6

```

## OKR

I want to use the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) model of making and measuring goals.

#### Objectives should be really difficult to reach. Google re:Work summary "OKR and Stretch Goals":

> Google often sets goals that are just beyond the threshold of what seems possible, sometimes referred to as “stretch goals”. Creating unachievable goals is tricky as it could be seen as setting a team up for failure. However, more often than not, such goals can tend to attract the best people and create the most exciting work environments. Moreover, when aiming high, even failed goals tend to result in substantial advancements.

> The key is clearly communicating the nature of stretch goals and what are the thresholds for success. Google likes to set OKRs such that success means achieving 70% of the objectives, while fully reaching them is considered extraordinary performance.

> Such stretch goals are the building blocks for remarkable achievements in the long term, or “moonshots”.

#### Objectives should be public

How could I make mine public? Should I make a small website that hooks into my OKR API?

This is an example of how this might work (not sure about how I define "mission and vision"; that might work better for a company than for me personally, because some of my goals might be unrelated. I guess unless I make my mission/vision broad enough):
