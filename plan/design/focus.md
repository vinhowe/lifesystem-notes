# Focus

A focus is a "deep work" (thanks Newport) wrapper around a set of tasks.

When you try to enter a focus, it requests several things:
* Task dependencies, like "eat breakfast" and "go running" (defined globally but customizable per-focus), should be completed.
* Swap space should be cleared
* A pre-defined (globally but customizable) checklist should be filled
    * Use the bathroom if you need to
    * Drink water and keep water nearby
    * Eat something if you need to
    * Clean your workspace and remove distractions
