# Issue: How do we define "context"?

What is the problem?

## Focus and Context

Focus seems like a term for different deep work categories; places where I want to spend time. Math/science, writing, piano, tricking graduate schools into letting me in.

Context, as it's defined by GTD, seems like it's too broad but also just incorrect--not synonymous anyway.

Context is like a description of the requirements for a task to happen. A label for the environmental dependencies required for that task to be completed. Like if I want to discuss something with Bryan, I need Bryan. If I want to print something on my computer, I need my computer. A recommended syntax for this is to just create a hashtag label for every labelled context, regardless of whether that context is a person, place or a tool. So everything I do with Bryan goes under #bryan, and everything on the computer goes under #computer. So it makes sense that when I schedule my day, if I mark the chunk of time from 1300 to 1400 with #bryan, I should see all of my tasks that need to be taken care of with Bryan. This makes sense, because what I'm saying is that I'm planning on meeting with him during that time slot. But for something more ambiguous,like #computer, scheduling for contexts makes less sense. Do I mark every chunk of time where I will have access to the computer, or do I set aside a chunk of time for tasks that might be dependent on it?
