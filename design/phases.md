# Phases

I can't just assume this will work as fully-fledged program, and I don't have time to build one. I don't know if all of my assumptions are correct, so I think I have to do this incrementally instead of all at once.

## Phase 1

I think I should try to build a manual system (in that I do most of the steps and scheduling) that is compatible, for the most part, with TickTick, the task management application I use right now. I would rather build something that uses both Taskwarrior and Timewarrior on the backend, but my concern is that Taskwarrior and Timewarrior are offline and would be harder to access on my phone. TickTick has a great mobile app but seriously lacks extensibility.
