## READ: NOT a core feature.
# Content list/notes/annotations ideas

I have a huge list of things to read later. My main goal is to be able to associate personal notes (documents) with media. I also want to have the best viewing window available for any given format.

There are ways I can think of to do this for at least two categories:

### Articles
I can host a service that converts articles into "readable" articles using [Firefox's Readability library](https://github.com/mozilla/readability). 55 of the 67 links I have marked as "article" passed a readability test in Firefox's reader mode.

The link to the original page should be at the top of the service-rendered page, so that I can go there if the rendering doesn't work.

The potential here is to be able to highlight and save pages, even if the original source changes or goes offline.

#### Annotations

Annotating articles...

### Videos

I can easily convert YouTube links to embedded links (`http://www.youtube.com/watch?v={VIDEO_ID} --> http://www.youtube.com/embed/{VIDEO_ID}`) immediately after they're added to the list. This way, I see the video full-screen with no distractions. I can also create another viewing service that actually embeds the YouTube iframe, which would allow me to build time-based annotation, which would be pretty cool.
