# Systems, end-to-end

Rules:
* Distinguish primary features from secondary features--decide what you'll sacrifice to make this actually happen
* This is a first pass, so it is okay to make some general assumptions about how core dependencies (like documents) work
* Try to design a version of this in isolation of other features (like issues, principles, decisions). We can include them later.
