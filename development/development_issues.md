# Development issues

* Need to define lists (like "books to read," or "things to learn")
* Need to design with offline support (caching and queue) SERIOUSLY SHOULD UNDERSTAND CRDT
* It isn't clear what the scope of issues is
* Don't have clear definition of decisions
* Need to clarify how versioning works for things like principles, where I want
* Need to figure out how rescheduling works
* Need to make sure I don't design something that translates poorly to mobile
